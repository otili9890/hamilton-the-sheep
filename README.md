### [Prototypes](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/tree/master/prototypes)

The prototypes created by the team 

#### [Low fidelity](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/tree/master/prototypes/low%20fidelity) 
The form of the low fidelity is a video demonstrating the soccer pong activity with the interaction of the two players being wizard of oz'ed.
#### [Medium fidelity](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/tree/master/prototypes/medium%20fidelity) 
Form of medium fidelity is a interactive prototype created in Unity demonstrating the soccer pong activity. To use this 
prototype, access the medium_prototype.readme file and download all the files in the given link then run the executable file on a touch enabled device. 

#### [Proof Of Concept](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/tree/master/prototypes/proof_of_concept)

The proof of concept consists of three different activities located at three different areas. To fully experience the concept would require 
the three activities being set up in their respective locations and users navigating from one activity to another based on the information 
gathered from each activity. Each activiy can be accessed individually through the following instructions below. 

##### [Soccer Pong Activity](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/tree/master/prototypes/medium%20fidelity) 

This prototype represents the soccer pong activity on a touch screen. In this activity two players play to score points by shooting the ball 
into the other persons goal. Plays control the ball by flicking it to shoot it in a direction of their choosing or by touching the ball to stop it. 
To use this prototype, download the files from the link in the readme file and run the executable. Requires a touchscreen device. 

##### [Drawing Activity](https://github.com/otili9890/hamilton-the-sheep/blob/master/prototypes/proof_of_concept/drawing_activity) 

This prototype represents the drawing activity. In this activity the user is given a drawing of a location and is asked to draw the location
to the best of their ability. This can either be done by touch or by mice input. 
To use this prototype, download the files from the link in the readme file and run the html file.

Interviewee : Connor, 4th year business/IT student. 


Me: What does Transport and social experiences around UQ mean to you?

Connor: uh it means the speed it takes to travel around UQ and the atmosphere provided by different parts of the university.

Me: you mentioned the atmosphere provided by UQ, does the atmosphere affect what route you would take to get around the Uni?

Connor: yes normally as i don't mind taking extra time to see walk a nicer route like at the uq likes but at the same time i like to experience different part of the uni and see what is happening around UQ. 

Me: can you elaborate on what you mean by "what is happening around UQ"

Connor: Yeah i mean I like to see what other people are doing at UQ. Different faculties act differently and its interesting to see them. Theres also usually events or booths that interest me.

Me: Thats interesting. Are you part of any social clubs and if so why that club?

Connor: Im part of the business club as thats part of what im studying and I like the perks that come with it. Um im also part of some other random societies that i never participate in.

Me: Is there any reason  you don't participate in them?

Connor: i just don't have time or some i joined with friends with intentions to do stuff with but then my friends never have time so i just don't participate.

Me: When travelling from one point of campus to another is there any technology or that would make your walk more engaging or social?

Connor: I'm not sure about technology but one reason i like taking the path through UQ lakes is the informational signs the have about the local fauna and flora. 

Me: Is there any specific reasons you like these signs?

Connor: Its always interesting reading about new things like that although they don't change it much so its nothing new for me now. 

Me: Okay sweet thanks for your time.
